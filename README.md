## Overview

A simple newsletter sing-up component created with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Add their email and submit the form
-   See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
-   See form validation messages if:
    -   The field is left empty
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

-   Check the assignment;
-   Split the tasks into smaller ones, that are easy solvable;
-   Proceed with mobile fist and then transition to desktop layout;
-   After creating the layouts, creating the logic;
-   Manual test;

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Practicing CSS, HTML and JS, but also trying to build components faster and with better abstraction.

### Continued development

I don't like the CSS i builded in this challenge and will try to improve on that subject. Have to work on accessability too.
